    # - none: deny all access for this verb/entity (hide pages + block APIs)
    # - all: ignore scope (read everything)
    # - own: only owned records (not applicable for logs - logs are system-level)

    # These are mutually exclusive per node; the Security Groups UI renders them as dropdowns.
    # Note: Logs pages are admin-only system pages. Scope modes are defined for consistency
    # with the entity+verb model, but in practice these pages require admin role.
